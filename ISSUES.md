## P0 — blocks the "useful B2C worker" claim

### #1 Generated worker is empty after create (no SKILL.md, no run.py)

**Where:** `POST /workers` (`apps/api/main.py:1506-1543`) + `apps/web/app/workers/new/page.tsx`

**Symptom:** Federico created `summarise-meetings` via prompt-to-worker. The draft LLM returned a `skill_md` body (per `_DRAFT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `main.py:1264`), but on the worker detail page nothing is shown. There is no SKILL.md viewer/editor, no run.py viewer, no code panel at all.

**Root cause:** Two bugs:
1. `POST /workers` writes a hardcoded placeholder SKILL.md (`main.py:1522-1526`) — it ignores any `skill_md` field on the payload. The LLM-generated body is discarded.
2. The `/workers/new` UI does not POST the generated `skill_md` to `POST /workers` even if the endpoint accepted it.
3. The worker detail page (`/workers/[id]`) does not render SKILL.md / run.py source.

**Fix scope:**
- Extend `WorkerCreateRequest` to accept optional `skill_md`; if present, write it to `SKILL.md` instead of the placeholder.
- Frontend: in `/workers/new` Step 2 "Create worker", include the `skill_md` from the draft response in the POST body.
- Frontend: on `/workers/[id]`, show a "Code" tab/section with SKILL.md (and run.py if pure-script) rendered + editable. Tied to #2.

**Status:** OPEN

### #2 Worker detail page uses cards; should be tabs

**Where:** `apps/web/app/workers/[id]/page.tsx`

**Symptom (Image #9):** Long vertical stack of cards: Description → Inputs → Outputs → Connections → Trigger → Enriched CSV preview → How it works → Run worker → Recent runs. Card layout makes navigation tedious and pushes "Run worker" below the fold.

**Federico:** "the card based logic is not good? should be tabs on a worker page or so?"

**Fix scope:** Replace card stack with tabs (suggested: `Overview / Run / Code / Connections / Runs`). Tab content swaps in place. "Run worker" becomes the first/default tab so the primary action is one click from page load.

**Status:** OPEN

---

### #3 Sidebar layout breaks on scroll

**Where:** `apps/web/app/workers/[id]/page.tsx` + global layout. Image #8 shows the left nav going off-screen when the page content scrolls (csv_enricher /workers/csv_enricher).

**Federico:** "sidebar broken on scroll"

**Fix scope:** The left sidebar nav should be `position: sticky; top: 0; height: 100vh; overflow-y: auto;` (or equivalent flex layout) so it stays pinned while main content scrolls.

**Status:** OPEN

---

### #4 Connections logic on /workers/new is wrong (Image #11)

**Where:** `apps/web/app/workers/new/page.tsx` Step 2 + `/workers/draft-from-prompt` connection inference in `apps/api/main.py:1296-1302`

**Symptom (Image #11):** For the meeting-summary worker, "Set up requirements" shows:
- API KEYS: GRANOLA_API_KEY, HUBSPOT_API_KEY
- OAUTH CONNECTIONS: HubSpot, Granola, Google Calendar

Federico: "It should be either OAuth or Secrets for HubSpot and Granola here, so it should not be both." Plus Google Calendar shouldn't be present at all if the prompt was meetings + HubSpot. The connection list is bleed-over from `_COMPOSIO_APP_KEYWORDS` keyword detection (meeting → google-calendar).

**Fix scope:**
- For each integration the worker needs, present ONE choice: OAuth (preferred) OR API key, not both. Decide based on whether Composio supports OAuth for that app.
- Tighten connection inference: don't include apps that weren't explicitly mentioned in the prompt. "Granola meetings" doesn't imply Google Calendar.
- Better: let the LLM return a structured `requirements` array with `{app, method: oauth|api_key}` per item, and trust that over keyword inference.

**Status:** OPEN

---

### #5 No file upload when running a CSV worker (Image #8)

**Where:** `apps/web/app/workers/[id]/page.tsx` Run worker form

**Symptom (Image #8):** The csv_enricher Run form has a single-line `CSV rows` text input that says "name,companyAlice,AcmeBob,Stark" as placeholder. Federico has to paste CSV inline. He expects a real file upload.

**Federico:** "have real csv uploads etc if csv?"

**Fix scope:**
- For `kind: file` worker inputs, render `<input type="file">` with appropriate `accept` (text/csv, application/pdf, image/*, etc.) per the input's `media_type`.
- POST the file via the existing `/uploads` endpoint, then pass the upload reference to `/workers/{id}/runs`.
- The csv_enricher worker's `csv_rows` input should declare `kind: file, media_type: text/csv` instead of `kind: scalar, type: string`.

**Status:** OPEN

### #6 No way to upload your own SKILL.md when creating a worker

**Where:** `apps/web/app/workers/new/page.tsx`

**Symptom:** /workers/new only offers a prompt textarea. Federico originally expected "you write your own skill MD" (paste or upload .md file). The prompt-to-worker flow is good, but he wants the option to upload a SKILL.md too.

**Federico:** "when creating a worker, I should also be able to upload files and not just insert text. I actually thought we will just do 'you write your own skill MD'... It's also fine. I think it's even better, but yeah."

**Fix scope:** Add an "Upload SKILL.md" tab/button on /workers/new. Drop file in → parse content → skip Step 1 (prompt) and jump straight to Step 2 (Review + Create), prefilling SKILL.md and letting the user fill `name`, `title`, requirements manually OR re-run the draft-from-prompt against the uploaded SKILL.md to back-fill metadata.

**Status:** OPEN

### #7 "Connect a tool" modal is a fixed list, not searchable, not scrollable (Image #14)

**Where:** `apps/web/app/connections/page.tsx` + the modal component

**Symptom (Image #14):** Modal shows ~11 connect options (Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Slack, Notion, Linear, GitHub, HubSpot, Salesforce, LinkedIn, Apollo). The list is fixed — no search box, doesn't scroll past Apollo, and there's no way to reach the other ~1030 integrations from /connections/browse.

**Federico:** "The connected tool is not a list, which I cannot even scroll right now. Obviously it should be something I can search through, like a proper marketplace list for all the tools I can connect to."

**Fix scope:** Replace the fixed modal with a searchable marketplace inline (or inside the modal):
- Search box at top
- Category filter chips
- Paginated/virtualised list of all 1043 catalog integrations
- Reuses `GET /integrations/catalog?search=&category=&page=&limit=` which already exists and works.

This is essentially merging `/connections/browse` into the connections page or linking to it from the modal.

**Status:** OPEN

### #8 "Scopes unavailable" on every connection (Images #12, #13)

**Where:** `apps/web/components/connections/ConnectionCard.tsx:100` + API `GET /connections` projection (`apps/api/main.py:2205-2278`)

**Symptom:** Every connection card (Gmail, Google Drive, LinkedIn) shows "Scopes unavailable".

**Root cause:** The API `ConnectionItem` schema does not include `scopes`. The DB stores `composio_connection_id` but never queries Composio for the connection's scope list. Frontend's `connection.scopes` is always `[]` → falls into the "Scopes unavailable" branch.

**Fix scope:**
- Extend `ConnectionItem` to include `scopes: List[str]`.
- On `GET /connections` (or `GET /connections/{id}/status`), call Composio's connected-account info endpoint and project the scope list.
- Cache scopes in the DB row (denormalize) so we don't hit Composio for every list call. Refresh on reconnect.

**Status:** OPEN

---

### #9 "Connected as unknown account" on every connection (Image #12)

**Where:** Same as #8

**Symptom:** Every connection card shows "Connected as unknown account" instead of the actual signed-in identity (e.g. `depontefede@gmail.com`).

**Root cause:** `ConnectionItem` has no `accountLabel`/`account_label` field. Frontend reads `connection.accountLabel` (`ConnectionCard.tsx:79`) which is undefined; some upstream code likely substitutes "unknown account".

**Fix scope:**
- Extend `ConnectionItem` to include `account_label: Optional[str]`.
- Project the Composio connected-account email/handle when listing.
- Cache in DB.

**Status:** OPEN — same backend touchpoint as #8; ship them together.

### #10 "Connections backend not configured on this server" toast on every action (Image #15)

**Where:** `apps/web/app/connections/connected-accounts/[id]/route.ts:27-33`, `apps/web/app/connections/auth-configs/[id]/route.ts:33`

**Symptom:** Clicking Reconnect / Disconnect / opening a connection detail surfaces a red toast "Connections backend not configured on this server". The frontend cannot fetch account info or scopes for any connection.

**Root cause:** Both Next.js server-side routes read `process.env.COMPOSIO_API_KEY`. The variable IS set on the API service (`/root/.config/workeros/api.env`) but NOT on the Vercel web project — the Next route returns 503 immediately.

**Fix scope (two options):**
- **Quick:** Add `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` to the Vercel `workeros-web` project env vars (requires Federico's approval per CLAUDE.md env-var rule).
- **Cleaner (recommended):** Proxy these calls through the FastAPI service. Move the logic from `connections/connected-accounts/[id]/route.ts` + `connections/auth-configs/[id]/route.ts` into new endpoints on `apps/api/main.py` (`GET /connections/{id}/account-info`, `GET /connections/{id}/auth-config`), so the Composio key only lives on the API. The Next routes become thin proxies. This also removes the duplicate `fetchLocalComposioConnectionIds` ownership check that already exists upstream.

**Status:** OPEN — recommend the cleaner option since it shrinks the secret blast radius.

### #11 No "Test connection" button (Image #16)

**Where:** `apps/web/components/connections/ConnectionCard.tsx:109-130` — only Reconnect + Disconnect render. Compare with `/secrets` which already exposes a Test button (`apps/api/main.py` has `POST /secrets/{name}/test`).

**Federico:** "Why can't I test my connections?... I should see when it was last checked. It's super important, same as secrets."

**Fix scope:**
- Backend: add `POST /connections/{id}/test` that calls a lightweight Composio endpoint (e.g. fetch the connected account; success means the token is still valid).
- Frontend: add Test button next to Reconnect/Disconnect on the connection card; show inline result (`Tested OK 2 min ago` / `Failed: token expired`).

**Status:** OPEN

---

### #12 No "last checked at" timestamp; need daily health check for connections AND secrets

**Where:** Connection cards show `Active` / `Expired` badges with no timestamp context. Same gap exists on `/secrets`.

**Federico:** "It's checked every day to see if the secrets or connections still work. If they expire, I have to know. They show active and expired, but they should explain that it was last checked when."

**Fix scope:**
- Backend: extend `composio_connections` and `secrets` tables with `last_checked_at TIMESTAMP NULL` + `last_check_status TEXT NULL` + `last_check_error TEXT NULL`.
- Add a daily cron (systemd timer or in-process scheduler) that iterates every connection + secret, calls the test endpoint, and updates the columns.
- Surface `last_checked_at` + `last_check_status` on `GET /connections` and `GET /secrets`.
- Frontend: render `Last checked 2 hours ago · valid` / `Last checked 1 day ago · failed` under each badge.

**Status:** OPEN — ties together with #11 (test endpoint is the per-call primitive used by the daily sweep).

## Sequencing

Suggested PR cuts (parallelizable):

1. **PR A — Worker code lifecycle** (#1 + #2 + #6): backend `POST/PUT /workers` accept `skill_md`; frontend `/workers/new` posts it; `/workers/[id]` becomes tabs with Overview/Run/Code/Connections/Runs; upload SKILL.md option on /workers/new.
2. **PR B — Connections backend + projection** (#8 + #9 + #10 + #11 + #12): move Composio account/scopes/test calls server-side into FastAPI so the key stops being a Vercel env. Add `POST /connections/{id}/test` + `last_checked_at` columns + daily sweep. Project `account_label` + `scopes` + `last_checked_at` on `GET /connections`. Same migration covers `secrets`.
3. **PR C — Connections marketplace UX** (#7): replace fixed "Connect a tool" modal with searchable paginated list backed by `GET /integrations/catalog`.
4. **PR D — Requirements UX** (#4): tighter connection inference + one-method-per-app (OAuth XOR API key).
5. **PR E — Run inputs + sidebar scroll** (#3 + #5): file inputs for `kind: file`; sticky sidebar.

PR A and PR B are the heaviest. PR B is the most launch-critical (connections are unusable right now).

**Total estimated effort:** 10-14 hours of focused work split across the 5 PRs.
